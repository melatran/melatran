**“My vision is to be an empathetic developer working on projects to improve the lives of underrepresented groups and promoting for diverse representation in the field of Tony Starks 👩🏻‍💻”**

I'm an empathetic software developer who is passionate about designing and contributing to projects to help those without a voice find a voice in this society. As a former educator, my work focused on helping students in high risk communities. I enjoy developing software through agile workflow - if no one cares about it, what was the point?! One of my favorite hobbies is storytelling and listening to others. If there's a problem, I work hard to craft a solution. When I'm not at my computer, you can find me cuddling with my maltichon, MoMo, or stuffing my face with food listening to the latest K-POP songs.
