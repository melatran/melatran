I'm an empathetic software developer who is passionate about designing and contributing to projects to help those without a voice find a voice in this society. As a former educator, my work focused on helping students in high risk communities. From that job, I discovered a passion for storytelling. I enjoy listening to others and design a plan to help combat the issue. When I'm not at my computer, you can find me cuddling with my maltichon, MoMo, or stuffing my face with food listening to the latest K-POP songs.
